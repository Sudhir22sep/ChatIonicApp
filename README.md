# ChatIonicApp
An ionic chat application using the socket.io

It is obvious that we need npm and nodejs with the [ionic](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/installation/) installed on our machine to run this app.

# Building our Node Chat Server
This tutorial starts with the actual backend for our app.
Itâ€™s good to have some Node skills so you could potentially build your own little backend from time to time.
First of all we create a new folder and inside an NPM package file,
where we also install Express as a minimal framework for our backend:


```bash
$ mkdir SocketServer && cd SocketServer
```

```bash
$ npm init
```

```bash
$ npm install --save express socket.io
```

After creating and installing you should have a package.json inside that file.
Make sure inside that file the main file is set to index.js so the scripts knows which file to start!

```bash
{
  "name": "socket-server",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.15.3",
    "socket.io": "^2.0.3"
  }
  
  ```
  # Git clone this repo or download
  ```bash
  $ git clone path  
  ```
  download and install npm to it and run first the backend server and later run this repo app then you can access the chat application.
  
  Enjoy, have a nice day...
